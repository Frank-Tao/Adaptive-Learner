The Adaptive Player UI captures learner signals primarily through interaction rather than interrogation, emitting structured events that update the learner model and inform the next learning moment.

 

1. Purpose of this document
This document defines:

UI states and components

User interaction flows

Event capture and data contracts

Design constraints and non-goals

It is intended to be implementation-ready for web development.

2. Product boundary (important)
Adaptive Player is a UI shell, not an agent.

It renders learning moments, captures signals, and calls backend intelligence.

All pedagogical decisions happen server-side.

Frontend responsibility = sense → render → capture → respond.

3. Design principles (non-negotiable)
One cognitive job per screen

One recommendation, one alternative

No mandatory data entry

Signals captured through interaction, not forms

Explain decisions only when asked

Never label learner states in the UI

5. Implicit event capture (automatic)
These events are captured without UI prompts.

Event

Trigger

TIME_TO_FIRST_ACTION

Moment rendered → first click

TIME_ON_MOMENT

Enter → exit moment

HINT_USED

Hint button clicked

ATTEMPT_SUBMITTED

Task interaction

PAUSE

App backgrounded

RESUME

App foregrounded

SKIP

Moment skipped

EXIT

Session terminated

Example:



{
  "event": "HINT_USED",
  "moment_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
}
6. Derived learner states (backend-only)
Frontend never computes or displays these.

Success

Struggle

Disengagement

Working style

Mastery estimate

Modality effectiveness

Frontend only emits raw interaction signals.

7. “Why this?” microcopy contract
UI Rule
Collapsed by default

Max 2 sentences

Benefit-framed

Example Payload


{
  "why_this": "You’ve been learning in short bursts, and this step is about applying—not understanding—so a checklist should help you act quickly."
}
8. What NOT to build (explicit non-goals)
❌ Onboarding questionnaires
❌ Learning style settings
❌ Profile dashboards
❌ Scores or mastery meters
❌ “You are struggling” messages

These undermine trust and retention.

9. Frontend–Backend contract (summary)
Frontend sends

UI events

User choices

Timing data

Backend returns

Next moment specification

Feedback text

Optional rationale

Allowed alternatives

10. Technical readiness checklist
Before coding, confirm:

Event schema agreed

Moment spec JSON defined

State machine implemented

Time thresholds configurable

Accessibility (keyboard, screen reader)

Mobile-first breakpoints

11. The Minimum Viable UI (what you actually need)
A. Session Start UI (≤ 10 seconds)
Purpose: Establish context, not profile.

UI elements (on one screen)
Goal prompt (single line)

“What are you trying to do right now?”

Free text OR 3–5 smart suggestions

Time selector (critical)

Buttons: 2 min · 5 min · 10+ min

Confidence slider (optional, skippable)

“How confident do you feel?” (1–5)

Why this works
Time available is the highest-value signal for adaptivity

Confidence gives early calibration

Goal anchors relevance

⚠️ Do NOT ask for background, level, experience, or preferences here.

B. Learning Moment UI (the core screen)
This is where most data is captured passively.

Structure
One learning task per screen

Clear action (“Try this”, “Choose”, “Apply”)

No scrolling if possible

What the UI captures automatically
Time to first action

Time on task

Pauses / resumes

Hint usage

Errors and retries

Skips

This gives you:

mastery signals

working style signals

friction indicators
without asking anything explicitly

C. Micro Check-ins (high leverage, low effort)
Instead of surveys, use single-tap micro prompts after action.

Examples:

“That felt: 👍 Clear / 😐 Okay / 👎 Confusing”

“Want another example, or move on?”

“Too fast / Just right / Too slow”

These:

feel conversational

take <1 second

directly inform the next step

📌 Rule: One micro check-in every 2–3 learning moments max.

D. Confidence Calibration UI (only when it matters)
Only surface confidence prompts:

after success

after repeated struggle

Example:

“How sure do you feel you could do this again tomorrow?”

This is metacognitive gold, but only when well-timed.

12. How the UI supports adaptivity without exposing complexity
“Why this?” UI (trust builder)
A small, expandable affordance:

“Why am I seeing this?”

When tapped:

1–2 sentences max

Always framed around benefit, not system logic

Example:

“You’ve been learning in short bursts, and this step is about applying—not understanding—so a checklist should help.”

Never show:

scores

classifications

internal labels (“struggle”, “disengaged”)

Choice without overload
Always show:

one recommended path

one alternative (link or button)

Example:

“Try this checklist”

“Prefer a short explanation instead?”

This preserves agency without decision fatigue.

13. Progressive learner profile (invisible but powerful)
From a UI perspective:

There is no “profile setup”

There is no dashboard of traits

There is no settings page for learning style

Instead:

The learner experiences personalization

The system earns confidence gradually

You may later add:

A “What I’ve learned about you” summary

But only after repeated value delivery
