Adaptive Learning - Technical Specification
Overview
Adaptive Learning is a real-time learning orchestrator that classifies learner state from signal bundles and selects the next best learning moment. The system emphasizes trend-based classification and uncertainty scoring.

System Components
Event Collector: captures performance, temporal, interaction, and metacognitive signals.

State Classifier: computes state + certainty using bundled signals across 2-3 steps.

Moment Selector: chooses the next learning moment based on state and context.

Response Renderer: presents the moment with explanation and options, interactive coach and feedback

Analytics Pipeline: aggregates session and moment metrics, and cross-subject learning objectives  for each learner profile?

Evaluation module at the back end to analyze the agents' performance for improvement.

Learner profile?

The experience assembly layer and the overall workflow control?

Data Flow
User action emits signal event.

Signals are normalized and aggregated in a sliding window.

Classifier outputs {state, certainty, reasons}.

Moment selector decides the next action and response template.

Renderer outputs the moment and records follow-up signals.

Classification Logic (Baseline)
Never classify from a single signal.

Track trends across 2-3 steps (configurable).

Provide certainty: low/medium/high.

Success (example): correct or successful action, attempts <= 2, hint_count <= 1, confidence >= 3, time-on-step in range.

Struggle (example): 2+ of incorrect, attempts >= 2, hint_count >= 2, time-on-step above expected, confidence <= 2, repeating error pattern.

Disengagement (example): skip without attempt OR exit mid-step OR idle > T_idle OR repeated deferrals.

Adaptive Response Rules
Success: acknowledge briefly, provide one transfer prompt, offer next step.

Struggle: pause progression, diagnose cause, adjust one variable (simplify, switch format, add example).

Disengagement: shorten next moment, lower load, offer graceful exit, never guilt.

Tone: Avoid being prescriptive or overwhelming

Session State Machine (Macro)
Enter SESSION_DE_RISK if 2 consecutive disengage signals OR friction_score exceeds threshold.

SESSION_CLOSE outputs capability statement, next suggested moment, optional reminder.

Interfaces (Internal)
/events ingest: event payloads for signals.

/classify: returns state + certainty + reasons.

/next-moment: returns moment type + response template., alternatives?

Configurables
Thresholds for time, attempts, hints, confidence.

Window size for trend classification.

Moment catalog and response templates.

Observability
State distribution over time.

Misclassification proxies (rapid flips, user overrides).

Recovery rate from struggle to success.

Diagnose disengagement, conversion rate from disengagement to success, correlation between disengagement and struggle?
