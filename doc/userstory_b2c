User Story 1 — B2C (Primary v1)
Persona
Name: Alex
Role: Senior Sales Executive
Context: Outside work hours, self-driven career progression
Goal: Improve negotiation skills to be ready for a bigger role at another company
Constraint: Limited time, fragmented attention, no formal training support

Scenario Narrative (End-to-End)
Entry: “Leave workflow → return in 3 minutes”
After dinner, Alex remembers a negotiation that didn’t go well earlier in the week.
He opens Adaptive Player on his phone.

UI State 0 — Session Start
UI prompts (single screen):

“What are you trying to do right now?”

Alex types: “Get better at handling price objections.”

Time selector: 5 min

Optional confidence slider: 3 / 5

Call to Action (CTA): Start

Captured signals:

Goal intent: applied skill

Time constraint: short

Confidence baseline: medium

UI State 1 — Learning Moment (Adaptive)
Rendered learning moment (implicit 6W):

Format: Guided checklist

Task:
“Try this 3-step structure the next time a client pushes back on price.”

Action:
“Reframe → Probe → Anchor value”

Optional hint: “Example phrasing”

UI characteristics:

One task

No scrolling

Clear action

Why this works (optional, collapsed):

“You’re short on time and focused on application, so this is designed to be used immediately.”

UI State 2 — Feedback Loop
After Alex completes the checklist:

Feedback UI:

“That’s a solid structure.”

“How did that feel?”

👍 Clear

😐 Okay

👎 Confusing

Alex taps 😐 Okay.

Signals captured:

Partial clarity

Effort present, not mastery

UI State 3B — Struggle Adjustment (Adaptive)
System inference (not shown):

Procedural struggle

Modality mismatch possible

UI adjustment prompt:

“What would help most right now?”

Options:

Walk through a real example

See a short script

Try a quick practice question

Alex selects “Walk through a real example.”

UI State 1 (Adjusted Moment)
New learning moment:

A short, realistic dialogue showing price objection handling

One decision point (“What would you say next?”)

Alex answers correctly without hints.

UI State 3A — Success Reinforcement
UI prompt:

“Nice — you handled the objection cleanly.”

Optional confidence check:

“Could you do this again tomorrow?”

Alex selects 4 / 5

UI State 4 — Session Close
Capability-based summary:

“You can now respond to price objections using a clear 3-step structure.”

Next suggestion (non-forcing):

“When you have time: handling ‘We need approval’ objections.”

Options:

Continue

Save for later

Alex taps Save for later and closes the app.

Follow-up (Nudge, later)
The next evening, Adaptive Player sends a gentle nudge:

“Want a 2-minute practice on handling ‘We need approval’ objections?”

No guilt. No streak pressure.

Why this is JIT (even outside workflow)
Alex entered with a real problem

The system respected time and context

Learning was immediately applicable

Exit was expected and supported

 

 Mastery, Recovery & Reinforcement Flow — Alex’s 2nd scenario (B2C)
UI State 1 — Learning Moment (Orchestrated)
Adaptive Player orchestrates:

A short, role-relevant negotiation scenario

A guided decision checkpoint

No external links (all contained)

Rendered as a single learning moment:

Format: Scenario-based application

Task:

“A client says: ‘Your price is higher than your competitors.’
What do you say next?”

Structure:

One scenario

One decision point

One short response (typed or selected)

Why this works (optional, collapsed):

“You’re building fluency, so this focuses on applying the structure in a realistic moment.”

UI State 2 — Feedback Loop
After Alex submits his response:

Feedback prompt:

“How did that feel?”

Options:

👍 Clear

😐 Okay

👎 Confusing

Alex selects: 👍 Clear

Signals captured (not shown):

Correct response

First attempt success

No hint usage

Time-on-step within expected range

Mastery Detected (Implicit)
System inference (internal only):

Procedural mastery emerging

Confidence aligned with performance

No friction indicators

Decision:
Proceed to reinforcement, not repetition.

UI State 3A — Reinforcement (Mastery Path)
UI message:

“Nice — that response keeps the conversation focused on value.”

Reinforcement prompt (transfer-focused):

“How would you respond if the client added:
‘We need internal approval before moving forward.’”

Alex answers successfully.

UI State 3A (Optional Confidence Calibration)
Optional prompt:

“How confident do you feel handling objections like this in a real call?”

Scale:

○1 ○2 ○3 ○4 ○5

Alex selects: 4 / 5

Signals captured:

Confidence accuracy (aligned)

Readiness for next complexity level

Micro-Recovery (Preventive, Not Reactive)
Even with mastery, the system performs a light recovery check:

System decision (internal):

Avoid adding complexity immediately

Prevent overconfidence escalation

Space reinforcement

No UI interruption occurs.

(This is important: recovery does not always mean visible adjustment.)

UI State 4 — Session Close (Mastery-Framed)
Capability-based summary:

“You can now respond to common price objections using a clear, value-anchored structure.”

Next suggested moments (optional):

“Handling ‘We need approval’ objections”

“Negotiating under deadline pressure”

CTAs:

Continue

Save for later

Alex selects Save for later and exits.

Reinforcement Nudge (Delayed, Optional)
Later that week, Adaptive Player sends one gentle reinforcement nudge:

“Want a 2-minute practice on handling ‘We need approval’ objections?”

If Alex ignores it:

No follow-up

No penalty

No streak break

Why this mastery flow matters
Mastery is treated as a state to stabilize, not accelerate recklessly

Reinforcement focuses on transfer, not repetition

Recovery is preventive, not only reactive

The learner exits feeling capable, not “finished”

Parallelism with Other Flows (for your spec)
Flow type

Trigger

Primary action

Outcome

Struggle

Cognitive friction

Simplify & adjust

Recovery through support

Disengagement

Context constraint

Reduce demand

Recovery through respect

Mastery

Stable success

Reinforce & transfer

Capability consolidation

All three:

Use the same UI states

Use different adaptive decisions

Preserve learner agency

Why this is critical for your product positioning
This is what separates Adaptive Player from:

chatbots (which keep answering)

courses (which keep progressing)

quizzes (which keep testing)

Your system knows when to:

teach

support

step back

That judgment is the product.

 

Added Step — Alex (B2C) Use Case
New Step: Learning Activity Feedback
Where it appears
After UI State 4 — Session Close
(before or alongside “Save for later”)

UI State 5 — Activity Feedback (Alex)
UI prompt:

“Help improve this practice?”

Options:

👍 Worked well

😐 Could be better

👎 Didn’t help

Alex selects 😐 Could be better.

Follow-up (one tap):

Too basic

Too long

Not realistic enough

Alex selects Not realistic enough.

What Adaptive Player captures (internal)


ACTIVITY_FEEDBACK {
  activity_id: "negotiation_objection_practice_v2",
  rating: "neutral",
  issue: "not_realistic",
  context: {
    learner_state: "mastery",
    modality: "scenario_based",
    time_available: 5
  }
}
How the system uses it (not shown to Alex)
Adjusts future scenario realism for Alex

Increases weight of:

real call transcripts

higher-stakes scenarios

Feeds evaluation module for:

template tuning

misfit detection

Alex is not asked again for this session.

Why this fits Alex’s journey
He feels heard without being slowed down

Feedback improves future moments

No implication that he “failed”

 

Why This Step Is Important (Strategically)
This feedback step:

Improves adaptivity quality

Not just learner modeling, but activity modeling

Protects UX

Optional

One tap

Never interrupts flow

Supports future enterprise value

Learning design insights

Role-based effectiveness analysis

Evidence for “adaptive ROI”

Avoids common traps

Not NPS

Not surveys

Not “rate yourself”

Where This Fits in Your Architecture
This feeds directly into your:

Evaluation module

Moment template tuning

Misclassification diagnostics

Content source weighting

Without touching:

learner profile UI

dashboards

visible scoring

One-line spec addition (you can paste this)
After each learning session, Adaptive Player optionally collects one-tap feedback on the learning activity to improve future adaptivity and template effectiveness, without evaluating learner performance.
