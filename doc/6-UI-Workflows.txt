# Adaptive Learning - UI Workflows

## Workflow 1: Session Start and Intent Capture
1. Landing / entry screen: user chooses goal or topic.
2. Quick intent capture: pick a mode (short burst vs deep focus) and confidence check (1-5).
3. Start session: system creates session_id and loads the first Moment Card.
4. Prompt Bar explains what will happen next in 1-2 lines.

## Workflow 1B: Enterprise Entry (B2B)
1. Entry via SSO portal or LMS deep link.
2. System context pre-filled (role, tool access, LMS history).
3. User confirms current goal and time available.
4. First Moment Card blends internal and external sources.

## Workflow 2: Learning Moment Micro-Loop (Default)
1. Moment Card shows a single step with a clear action.
2. User attempts the step and optionally rates confidence.
3. System records signals (attempts, hints, time-on-step, confidence).
4. State Classifier outputs {state, certainty, reasons}.
5. Prompt Bar shows a brief explanation and choice chips.
6. User selects next action (continue, switch format, save, exit).

## Workflow 3: Success Response
1. Acknowledge success briefly.
2. Offer one transfer prompt (apply in a new context).
3. Provide next step or exit option.
4. Log transfer success signal if attempted.

## Workflow 4: Struggle Response
1. Pause progression and signal a short diagnostic.
2. Offer one adjustment at a time (simplify, example, switch format).
3. Provide supportive feedback without over-teaching.
4. Continue with adjusted moment and re-evaluate.

## Workflow 5: Disengagement Response
1. Detect disengagement signals (skip, exit, idle, repeated deferral).
2. Show a low-friction moment (60-second recap or save for later).
3. Offer a graceful exit with no penalty.
4. Ask for optional feedback on context.

## Workflow 6: Feedback Window
1. After a moment, show a lightweight feedback window.
2. User can give a quick note or tap (helpful / not helpful).
3. Feedback is stored for evaluation and personalization.

## Workflow 7: Session Close (Macro-loop)
1. Trigger SESSION_CLOSE after repeated disengagement or session end.
2. Display capability statement (what learner can now do).
3. Offer next suggested moment and optional reminder.

## UI Building Blocks (Reference)
- Moment Card: single step with clear next action.
- Prompt Bar: short explanation of adaptation.
- Choice Chips: alternatives (switch format, save, exit).
- Feedback Window: quick feedback input.
