Adaptive Learning - Data and Signals Specification
Purpose
Define the signal set and data rules for learner state classification. Signals are lightweight, ethical, and focused on performance, effort, and confidence.

Signal Categories
Performance: correct/incorrect, successful action, error type.

Effort and Stability: attempts per step, hint usage, time-on-step vs expected.

Interaction: skips, modality switches, save-for-later, exits.

Metacognitive: confidence rating (1-5), quick clarity tap.

Signals to Avoid as Sole Inputs
Completion rate alone.

Time spent alone.

Scroll/view counts as engagement.

Event Schema (Baseline)
event_id: string

user_id: string (hashed)

session_id: string

moment_id: string

step_id: string

event_type: enum

timestamp: ISO-8601

value: number or string

metadata: object

Required Events
step_attempted

step_correct

hint_used

confidence_rating

step_skipped

session_exit

idle_timeout

modality_switch

Derived Metrics
attempts_per_step

hint_count_per_step

time_on_step

friction_score (weighted sum of retries, hints, over-time)

disengage_signal_count

Classification Support Fields
trend_window_size

confidence_alignment (performance vs self-reported)

uncertainty_score (based on signal strength + consistency)

Data Quality Rules
All step events must include moment_id, step_id, and session_id.

Confidence events must be associated with a step_id.

Idle timeouts should record last action timestamp.

Privacy and Ethics
No biometric or invasive signals.

Use only task-relevant interaction data.

Provide opt-out for confidence prompts.

UI Workflow Alignment
Explicit UI events: goal selection, time selection, confidence (pre/post), clarity tap, format choice.
Implicit interaction events: time to first action, time on step, hint used, attempts, errors, skips, pause/resume, exit.

Derived Fields for Orchestration
trend_window_size
uncertainty_score
intervention_level
working_style (short burst vs deep focus)
