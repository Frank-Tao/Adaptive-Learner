Adaptive Learning - Product Requirements (PRD)
Purpose
Define the internal product requirements for Adaptive Learning, a real-time learning experience that classifies learner state (success, struggle, disengagement) and adapts learning moments accordingly while preserving learner agency.

Goals
Act as a learning conductor, identify learner state based on proficiency, confidence, motivation/learning preference, and working style, using bundled, evidence and trend-based signals with consciousness of uncertainty.

Adapt the next learning moment to reinforce success, diagnose struggle, or reduce friction on disengagement, leveraging incremental analysis to achieve learning effectiveness and efficiencies in line with the learning objectives. 

Keep the learner in control of the learning  pace, format, and continuation with the provision of explainability, transparency in decision-making, alternatives, and reversible decisions.

Continuously reflect, evaluation and improve the services/recommendations, with evidence-based evaluation and customer feedback.

Typical Workflow (B2C)
Session start: capture goal, time available, and optional confidence.
Learning moment micro-loop: present one action, capture interaction signals, classify state, explain briefly, offer choices.
Success response: reinforce and transfer, offer next step or exit.
Struggle response: diagnose and adjust one variable at a time.
Disengagement response: reduce friction, offer recap or save-for-later, graceful exit.
Feedback window: quick micro-feedback to improve future moments.
Session close: capability statement and next suggested moment.

Typical Workflow (B2B)
Entry: launch from company portal (SSO) with system-provided context (role, tool access, LMS history).
Learning moment: unify internal Jira/Confluence content with a short external explainer.
Struggle response: simplify and keep it interactive.
Disengagement response: reduce demand, offer a 60-second summary, respect time pressure.
Session close: capability statement plus optional one-tap activity feedback for role fit.
Enterprise signals: content source attribution, role-aware outcomes, org-level insights.

Non-Goals
Building or delivering full courses.

Acting as a tutor or content generator.

Optimizing for surface engagement or completion alone.

Target Users
B2C learners in short-burst or focused sessions.
B2B teams and enablement leaders who need role-aware, trust-preserving learning moments.

Users with varied confidence, motivation, and context.

Adaptive Player is designed for busy, self-directed adults who are actively trying to learn and apply skills but are constrained by time, uncertainty, or lack of clarity. These learners don’t need more content or courses—they need guidance on what to do next, in a way that fits their working style and builds real capability. Adaptive Player supports learners who are already motivated but underserved by static learning platforms and generic AI explanations.

Website implementation guidelines
B2C home site: self-serve, mobile-first, no org context, no dashboards or course language.
B2C emphasis: quick application, personal confidence, graceful exits, optional one-tap activity feedback.
B2B business site: SSO + LMS context, internal content unification, compliance language, role-based outcomes.
B2B emphasis: separation of struggle vs disengagement, activity feedback tied to role fit, admin-level insights.

Strategic sequencing (pragmatic roadmap)
Phase 1 (Beachhead)

Busy professionals

One domain (e.g. applied AI, data, product)

Clear “unblock me now” value

Phase 2

Career switchers / structured upskillers

Add more scaffolding and reflection

Phase 3

Advanced / lifelong learners

More challenge, exploration, personalization depth

Same engine. Same Adaptive Player. Different framing.

Core Definitions
Success: performance, stability, and confidence are aligned.

Struggle: effort is present but progress is not.

Disengagement: withdrawal signals, not difficulty.

Primary Use Cases
User completes steps correctly and confidently; system reinforces and transfers.

User repeats errors or needs many hints; system diagnoses and adjusts.

User skips, exits, or idles; system reduces friction or offers exit.

Success Metrics
Increased repeat usage and session return rate.

Reduced friction score (hints + time + retries).

Improved recovery from struggle to success.

Lower false-disengagement interventions.

Risks and Mitigations
Misclassification risk: use bundled signals and uncertainty scoring.

Over-intervention: low certainty should trigger probes, not strong changes.

Privacy: limit signals to lightweight and ethical inputs.

Dependencies
Reliable instrumentation of signals.

Baseline content/moment formats (checklist, micro-lesson, prompt).

UX patterns for explanation and choice.

Learner profile module

Backend approach
Multi-agent orchestration for event collection, signal aggregation, state classification, moment selection, response composition, and evaluation.
