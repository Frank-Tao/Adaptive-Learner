# Adaptive Learning - Product Requirements (PRD)

## Purpose
Define the internal product requirements for Adaptive Learning, a real-time learning experience that classifies learner state (success, struggle, disengagement) and adapts learning moments accordingly while preserving learner agency.

## Goals
- Identify learner state using bundled, trend-based signals with uncertainty.
- Adapt the next learning moment to reinforce success, diagnose struggle, or reduce friction on disengagement.
- Keep the learner in control with transparent, reversible decisions.

## Non-Goals
- Building or delivering full courses.
- Acting as a tutor or content generator.
- Optimizing for surface engagement or completion alone.

## Target Users
- B2C learners in short-burst or focused sessions.
- Users with varied confidence, motivation, and context.

## Core Definitions
- Success: performance, stability, and confidence are aligned.
- Struggle: effort is present but progress is not.
- Disengagement: withdrawal signals, not difficulty.

## Primary Use Cases
- User completes steps correctly and confidently; system reinforces and transfers.
- User repeats errors or needs many hints; system diagnoses and adjusts.
- User skips, exits, or idles; system reduces friction or offers exit.

## Success Metrics
- Increased repeat usage and session return rate.
- Reduced friction score (hints + time + retries).
- Improved recovery from struggle to success.
- Lower false-disengagement interventions.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Misclassification risk: use bundled signals and uncertainty scoring.
- Over-intervention: low certainty should trigger probes, not strong changes.
- Privacy: limit signals to lightweight and ethical inputs.

## Dependencies
- Reliable instrumentation of signals.
- Baseline content/moment formats (checklist, micro-lesson, prompt).
- UX patterns for explanation and choice.
