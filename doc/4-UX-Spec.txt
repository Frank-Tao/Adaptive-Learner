Adaptive Learning - UX Specification
UX Principles
Learner agency: all adaptive moves are explainable and reversible.

Respect attention: short, minimal interventions.

No guilt, no nagging.

Core UI Patterns
Moment Card: single learning moment with clear next action.

Prompt Bar: short confirmatory prompt or explanation of adaptation.

Choice Chips: quick alternatives (switch format, save for later, exit).

Feedback window (like MS Clippy?)

Success State Experience
Acknowledge briefly.

Offer one transfer or retrieval prompt.

Provide feedback, recommend next step, or exit to apply. 

Struggle State Experience
Pause progression and diagnose.

Offer one adjustment at a time (simplify, switch format, example).

Maintain a constructive and encouraging tone, offer timely feedback and more scaffolding support

Disengagement State Experience
Shorten the next moment.

Offer a 60-second summary or save-for-later.

Ask for feedback, insights for content/experience improvement.

Provide a graceful exit with no penalty.

Transparency and Control
Explain why an adaptation happened in 1-2 lines.

Always provide an alternative path or skip option.

Edge Cases
Low certainty classification: ask a brief probe question, do not alter flow dramatically.

Conflicting signals: default to minimal intervention.

Accessibility
Keyboard navigable controls.

Clear, plain language.

Avoid color-only indicators.

Workflow Notes (Typical UI)
Moment Card: single action, no scrolling when possible.
Prompt Bar: brief explanation, collapsed by default.
Choice Chips: one recommendation, one alternative, plus save/exit.
Feedback Window: lightweight, optional micro-feedback after moments.
Micro check-ins: simple taps (clear/ok/confusing) every 2-3 moments.
Why this?: 1-2 sentences, benefit-framed, no internal labels.
