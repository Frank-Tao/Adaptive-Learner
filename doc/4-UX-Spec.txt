Adaptive Learning - UX Specification
UX Principles
Learner agency: all adaptive moves are explainable and reversible.

Respect attention: short, minimal interventions.

No guilt, no nagging.

B2C vs B2B experience cues
B2C entry: self-serve, short time choices, personal goals, no org context.
B2B entry: SSO portal launch with role, tool access, and LMS history pre-filled.
B2C content: fully contained moments, no internal links required.
B2B content: unify internal and external sources with source attribution.
Struggle vs disengagement: keep separate tones ("Let’s simplify this" vs "Now might not be the best moment").
Activity feedback: one-tap role-fit feedback after session close, optional and non-blocking.

Core UI Patterns
Moment Card: single learning moment with clear next action.

Prompt Bar: short confirmatory prompt or explanation of adaptation.

Choice Chips: quick alternatives (switch format, save for later, exit).

Feedback window (like MS Clippy?)

Success State Experience
Acknowledge briefly.

Offer one transfer or retrieval prompt.

Provide feedback, recommend next step, or exit to apply. 

Struggle State Experience
Pause progression and diagnose.

Offer one adjustment at a time (simplify, switch format, example).

Maintain a constructive and encouraging tone, offer timely feedback and more scaffolding support

Disengagement State Experience
Shorten the next moment.

Offer a 60-second summary or save-for-later.

Ask for feedback, insights for content/experience improvement.

Provide a graceful exit with no penalty.

Transparency and Control
Explain why an adaptation happened in 1-2 lines.

Always provide an alternative path or skip option.

Edge Cases
Low certainty classification: ask a brief probe question, do not alter flow dramatically.

Conflicting signals: default to minimal intervention.

Accessibility
Keyboard navigable controls.

Clear, plain language.

Avoid color-only indicators.

Workflow Notes (Typical UI)
Moment Card: single action, no scrolling when possible.
Prompt Bar: brief explanation, collapsed by default.
Choice Chips: one recommendation, one alternative, plus save/exit.
Feedback Window: lightweight, optional micro-feedback after moments.
Micro check-ins: simple taps (clear/ok/confusing) every 2-3 moments.
Why this?: 1-2 sentences, benefit-framed, no internal labels.
