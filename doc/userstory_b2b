User Story 2 — B2B (Stage-2 Iteration)
Persona
Name: Priya
Role: Change Manager
Context: Leading a digital transformation program
Goal: Quickly master Jira and Confluence (including AI features) to lead credibly
Constraint: Heavy workload, fragmented schedule, internal systems already exist

Scenario Narrative (End-to-End)
Entry: Integrated but still moment-first
Priya accesses Adaptive Player via a company learning portal link.

UI State 0 — Session Start (Enterprise-aware)
UI prompts:

“What are you trying to do right now?”

Priya selects a suggestion:
“Understand how Jira AI can help with backlog refinement.”

Time selector: 10+ min

Confidence: 2 / 5

CTA: Start

Additional data (system-provided, not asked):

Role: Change Manager

Tool access: Jira + Confluence enabled

Prior learning records pulled from LMS

UI State 1 — Learning Moment (Orchestrated)
Adaptive Player orchestrates:

Internal Jira micro-learning

One internal Confluence how-to page

A short, external explainer (e.g., Atlassian video)

Rendered as a single learning moment:

Format: Guided walkthrough

Task:
“Use Jira AI to generate backlog refinement suggestions.”

Clear steps with screenshots + optional video (2 min clip)

Why this works (optional):

“You’re preparing to lead others, so this focuses on practical use rather than configuration.”

UI State 2 — Feedback Loop
After attempting the task:

Feedback prompt:

“How did that feel?”

👍 Clear

😐 Okay

👎 Confusing

Priya selects 👎 Confusing.

UI State 3B — Struggle Adjustment
System inference:

Conceptual + tool-navigation struggle

UI adjustment:

“Let’s simplify this.”

Options:

One concrete use case

Short explainer (no clicks)

Save and revisit later

Priya selects One concrete use case.

UI State 1 (Adjusted Moment)
New moment:

A single scenario:
“You’re preparing a sprint planning meeting — here’s how Jira AI helps.”

Step-by-step with reduced cognitive load

Priya completes it successfully.

UI State 3A — Success Reinforcement
UI prompt:

“You can now use Jira AI to support sprint planning discussions.”

Confidence check: 3 / 5

UI State 4 — Session Close
Capability summary:

“You can confidently explain and use Jira AI for backlog refinement.”

Next suggestions:

“Using Confluence AI for change communications”

“Common pitfalls teams face with Jira AI”

Options:

Continue

Schedule for later

Enterprise-specific value unlocked
Internal + external content unified

No manual curriculum building

Learner profile enriched automatically

Same struggle/disengagement logic as B2C

Why these user stories work for UI design
Both stories:

Start with one question + time

Deliver one learning moment

Show adaptive adjustment

End with capability, not completion

Avoid dashboards, profiles, or content lists

Demonstrate JIT learning without tool integration dependency

Disengagement Flow (Parallel to Struggle Adjustment)_ Priya’s 2nd Scenario (B2B)
UI State 1 — Learning Moment (Orchestrated)
Adaptive Player orchestrates:

Internal Jira AI micro-learning

One internal Confluence how-to page

A short external explainer (e.g., Atlassian video, ≤2 min)

Rendered as a single learning moment:

Format: Guided walkthrough

Task:

“Use Jira AI to generate backlog refinement suggestions.”

Structure:

Step-by-step instructions

Screenshots for key actions

Optional short video (≤2 min)

Why this works (optional, collapsed):

“You’re preparing to lead others, so this focuses on practical use rather than configuration.”

Disengagement Emerges (Implicit, Not Shown)
During the learning moment, the system observes:

Extended idle time without interaction

App backgrounded and resumed multiple times

No attempt submitted

Time-on-step exceeds expected range

System inference (internal only):

Disengagement likely due to context switch or time pressure

No evidence of conceptual failure

UI State 3C — Disengagement De-Risk
UI adjustment message:

“Looks like now might not be the best moment.”

(Neutral, situational framing — no blame.)

Options presented:

60-second summary

Save and come back later

Come back tomorrow

Priya selects 60-second summary.

UI State 1 — Adjusted Learning Moment (De-Risked)
Rendered as a compressed learning moment:

Format: Ultra-short explainer

Content:

“Jira AI analyzes recent sprints and ticket patterns to suggest backlog items, helping you guide sprint planning discussions more efficiently.”

Characteristics:

No clicks required

No task completion expected

One key idea only

Why this works (optional):

“This gives you the idea now, without asking for focus you may not have.”

UI State 4 — Session Close (Disengagement Path)
Capability-framed close:

“You now understand how Jira AI supports backlog refinement at a high level.”

Next suggested options (optional):

“Try this hands-on when you have 10 minutes”

“See one real sprint-planning example”

CTAs:

Remind me later

End session

Priya selects Remind me later.

Follow-up Nudge (Optional, Deferred)
At a later, low-risk time window, Adaptive Player may send one nudge:

“When you have 5 minutes, want to see one real example of Jira AI in sprint planning?”

If ignored:

No escalation

No repeated reminders

No penalty

Key Differences vs Struggle Flow (Important for Implementation)
Aspect

Struggle Adjustment

Disengagement De-Risk

Primary cause

Cognitive / procedural friction

Context / attention constraint

Tone

“Let’s simplify this”

“Now might not be the best moment”

Adjustment

Change learning modality

Reduce learning demand

Revised moment

Still interactive

Passive, compressed

Expectation

Recovery through action

Recovery through respect

Outcome

Re-engagement now

Re-entry later

Why this separation matters (product clarity)
Prevents mislabeling disengagement as struggle

Avoids frustrating high-capacity learners under pressure

Preserves trust (especially critical in B2B contexts)

Keeps your adaptive logic diagnostically honest

Added Step — Priya (B2B) Use Case
New Step: Learning Activity Feedback
Where it appears
After Session Close (both mastery and disengagement paths)

UI State 5 — Activity Feedback (Priya)
UI prompt:

“Was this learning activity useful for your role?”

Options:

👍 Yes

😐 Partially

👎 Not really

Priya selects 😐 Partially.

Follow-up (one tap):

Too detailed

Too abstract

Hard to apply right now

Didn’t match my role

Priya selects Hard to apply right now.

What Adaptive Player captures (internal)


ACTIVITY_FEEDBACK {
  activity_id: "jira_ai_backlog_refinement_v1",
  rating: "partial",
  issue: "hard_to_apply",
  context: {
    role: "change_manager",
    learner_state: "disengagement",
    modality: "guided_walkthrough",
    time_available: 10
  }
}
How the system uses it (not shown to Priya)
For Priya:

Prioritizes use-case framing over feature walkthroughs

For the organization (later stage):

Flags this activity as “high friction for change roles”

Feeds enterprise learning design improvements

For Adaptive Player:

Improves struggle vs disengagement discrimination

No follow-up questions. No explanation required.

Why This Step Is Important (Strategically)
This feedback step:

Improves adaptivity quality

Not just learner modeling, but activity modeling

Protects UX

Optional

One tap

Never interrupts flow

Supports future enterprise value

Learning design insights

Role-based effectiveness analysis

Evidence for “adaptive ROI”

Avoids common traps

Not NPS

Not surveys

Not “rate yourself”

Where This Fits in Your Architecture
This feeds directly into your:

Evaluation module

Moment template tuning

Misclassification diagnostics

Content source weighting

Without touching:

learner profile UI

dashboards

visible scoring

One-line spec addition (you can paste this)
After each learning session, Adaptive Player optionally collects one-tap feedback on the learning activity to improve future adaptivity and template effectiveness, without evaluating learner performance.
